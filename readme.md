This app was a school assignment for the course VAVJS_B (Application development in JavaScript) at FIIT STUBA.

The app consists of a Express.js backend, React.js frontend and MySQL database, and runs on Docker. The goal of this project was to create a very simple webshop, where the user can buy 3 different kinds of items. The webshop contains a product page, a cart page and a checkout page. It contains an admin page aswell.
